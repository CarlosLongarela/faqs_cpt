# Frequently Asked Questions WordPress plugin

This plugin has been tested with WordPress v.4.7.5.

## What it does.

The **Frequently Asked Questions WordPress plugin** adds a new section to your WordPress Dashboard that allows you to create a list of Frequently Asked Questions to display on your website or blog pages or posts. 

For each Frequently Asked Question (FAQ), you can enter the following information:

* The question
* The answer
* The category
* The order in which it is to be listed.

## How to install it.

Follow these steps to install it:

1. Download the .zip file from [https://github.com/carmemias/faqs_cpt](https://github.com/carmemias/faqs_cpt)
2. Login to your WordPress site's and, in the Dashboard, click first **Plugins** and then **Add New**
3. Click the **Upload Plugin** button
4. Select the file you've just downloaded with the **browse** button and click **Intall Now** to finish.

Please notice that all plugins are desactivated by default after install. If you wish to use the plugin functionality you will have to **Activate** it after installation.

Once the plugin has been installed and activated, a new section called FAQs will appear in the left-hand side menu of your site's Dashboard.

## How to create a new FAQ.

To create a new FAQ, you can either:
